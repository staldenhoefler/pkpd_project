DESCRIPTION:
The administration can be either IV or extravascular with a zero order process (duration Tk0, bioavailability F).
IV doses (bolus/infusion) must be tagged with ADMINISTRATION ID=1 in the data set and extravascular doses with ADMINISTRATION ID=2.
IV doses can be via a bolus or an infusion (if INFUSION RATE or INFUSION DURATION column present in the data set).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a linear elimination (elimination rate k).

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {F, Tk0, V, k}

PK:
; PK model definition
compartment(cmt = 1, volume = V, concentration = Cc)
iv(adm = 2, cmt = 1)
oral(adm = 1, cmt = 1, Tk0, p = F)
elimination(cmt = 1, k)

OUTPUT:
output = {Cc}
